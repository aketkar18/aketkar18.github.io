        <h3> Skills and Interests </h3>
        <p class="spaced"> I am the most comfortable in the language C++ due to my academic exposure to it but practice
            competitive
            coding in Python and have a strong Java foundation. I recently learned HTML, CSS, and Javascript as evident by
            this website which was designed using those.
            I am also well-versed in the functional language Haskell and basic scripting in BASH. Outside of coding,
            I am proficient in Microsoft Office products including Word, Excel, and Powerpoint. I am also skilled at writing documents
            in LaTeX using the Overleaf editor. 
        </p>
        <p class="spaced">
            I find interest in many topics in the world of technology, but tend to pay attention the most to news in
            artifical intelligence as well as augmented reality. In the future, I wish to work in a machine learning project that involves training a model to work on
            music composition. This project could be useful to a game developer who wishes to have procedurally generated music in their game, so that players will never get tired 
            of the soundtrack and that the music always matches the tone of what area the player is in during gameplay. Designing this would unite my passions in coding, music, and game design.
