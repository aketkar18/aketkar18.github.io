        <h2> Introduction and Motivation </h2>
        <p> The target domain is people who have difficulty seeing and walking when there are unexpected surface elevation changes. When changes in surface elevation occur (ex: going down steps, going down a steep hill) in some environments, they can be hard to detect, making it easy to trip and fall. This could become a massive problem if it happens to someone with a walking disability, as falling could be a life threatening event. It is already really easy for someone without a walking disability to miss a step. It could be even harder for someone with a walker to see these changes since the walker obscures their vision. We hope to create an accessible device that will help mitigate these dangers.

        <p> The goal of the haptic walker is to detect unexpected changes in the walking surface and send a vibration to notify its user when a surface change is coming up. 
            The Haptic Walker is mainly going to be used by people that have a hard time walking. A few ways that we could simulate this limitation include adding additional weight to the walker if some people have problems with their muscles causing a limited range of motion. Alternatively, the walker can be used to support the visually and hearing impaired. To create viable constraints to show the limitations for people with vision problems, we can use a blindfold, use a dark location, foggy glasses, or glasses that simulate the experience of color blindness. To simulate the limitation of impaired hearing, we could use noise canceling headphones to make it much harder to hear.
