        <h2> Introduction and Motivation </h2>
        <p> The target domain is people who have difficulty seeing and walking when there are unexpected surface elevation changes. When changes in surface elevation occur (ex: going down steps, going down a steep hill) in some environments, they can be hard to detect, making it easy to trip and fall. This could become a massive problem if it happens to someone with a walking disability, as falling could be a life threatening event. It is already really easy for someone without a walking disability to miss a step. It could be even harder for someone with a walker to see these changes since the walker obscures their vision. We hope to create an accessible device that will help mitigate these dangers.

      <h2> Conclusion and future work </h2>
      <p> In conclusion, the proposed hardware solution with built-in belt sensors, LIDAR technology, and sound alerts connected to headphones via Bluetooth provides a reliable and efficient system for monitoring and controlling height inputs during physical activities. However, there are still some challenges that need to be addressed, such as adjusting sensors for people with different heights and connecting the hardware with new software techniques. In the future, a phone app could be developed to interface with the hardware and provide more control over the system, including light and sound options. Additionally, offering different belt colors and designs could make the hardware more appealing to a wider range of users. By implementing these future steps and addressing the challenges, this hardware solution could provide an excellent tool for individuals seeking to track and improve their physical activity performance. </p>
