        <h2> Volunteers in Plano </h2>
        <p>
            Volunteers in Plano is a city program designed to connect people to volunteer positions and exclusive opportunities to serve their community. 
            During my time here, I educated children by instructing them with various activities set up at public libraries in various locations throughout the City of Plano. 
            I also had a major project that involved examining creek water quality for the city's environmental department using various chemistry procedures.
                with coordination of partners. </p>

        <p>
            At the UT Southwestern Medical Center, I volunteered at the information desk and my job involved providing information and directions to visitors to the hospital.
            I occasionally was given the responsibility to escort patients to various locations throughout the buildings, which helped me gain essential communication and
            interpersonal skills.
