            <h2> Global Study Set </h2>
            <p class="small"> Global Study Set is a Java project that generates digital flashcards that automatically contains the same word in different languages. 
                It allows user to study cards, take quizzes on them, and add their favorites to a collection to study later. 
                It was heavily designed in object-oriented structure with advanced use of Java containers, generics, and bounded types.
                It utilizes a comma seperated text file containing parallel translation data to support five languages. </p>

            <h2> Harmonia </h2>
            <p class="small"> Harmonia was created with team during HowdyHack 2021; a hackathon hosted by the organization TAMUHack at Texas A&M. All brainstorming, planning, coding,
                and testing was done withingin a 24 hour period. Because of this, we delegated functions among our team and incorporated code from each member into final product.
                It was written entirely in Python and utilized Tkinter for a graphical user interface to display virtual piano keyboard.
                Additionally it used the playsound module to allow user to learn about triads and harmonies through auditory juxtaposition.

            <h2> Isomorpher </h2>
            <p class="small"> This project was created during my time as an undergraduate research assistant in the Aggie Research Program. The research was on graph mining with the open
                source engine Peregrine. The objective was to find which isomorphic variant of a pattern would perform the best when mining a large social media graph and analyze what causes the differences in performace.
                It is written in C++ and allows you enter an input graph it will exhuastively generate all isomorphic variants of the pattern. 
                It writes each variant in a seperate output file in the current directory and can addtionally generate LaTeX source code that displays each of the variants.

            <h2> HACK Assembler </h2>
            <p class="small"> 
                This is an assembler for the HACK Assembely language for the theoretical HACK Computer based on the Von Neumann architecture. It takes in the input of a .asm file that contains
                assembly code and generates a .hack file that contains the assembled machine code. This code can be run using the Nand2Tetris CPU emulator. 
                The project also includes a disassembler that will convert machine code back to assembly code.
